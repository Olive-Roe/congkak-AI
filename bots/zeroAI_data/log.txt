# for now playing simpleAI seems like a good way forward
# then after it can beat simpleAI by a large margin train it against itself or other playstyles
# playing just one playstyle changes its own playstyle and also limits its options
# but probably doesn't deprove it against other AIs yet

    # definitely some improvement
# three possibilities now: 
# training with grimple reduces winning against simple because it unlearns strategy
# training with grimple doesn't affect winning against simple because it specialises in grimple
# training improves winning against simple because it teaches it more playstyles

    59.45% # slight improvement from before

# training against one AI doesn't seem to affect the others (too significantly, 1000 games of grimple may not make a difference)
# which is good in that it doesn't overspecialise, but bad in the fact that it is not improving overall
# maybe training it against itself will yield the most overall improvement
# training against random may be a good base line as well, starting from the worst AI rather than the best
